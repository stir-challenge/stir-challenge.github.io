### Getting Started
Visit our [Synapse page](https://www.synapse.org/Synapse:syn65877821/wiki/631613) to participate and obtain further details on submission.

1. Register, and email a copy of the signed registration form to challenge.stir@gmail.com
2. Review the prior year's [challenge paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24306) for ideas.
3. Test your method, or modify a provided one using [STIRMetrics](https://github.com/athaddius/STIRMetrics) on the public component of the [STIR dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16782), or the [STIR Challenge 2024 test dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24306).
4. If interested in efficiency: experiment with exporting an ONNX/torchscript model. See [RAFT_STIR](https://github.com/athaddius/RAFT_STIR).
5. Submit a docker image for validation that your method runs (anytime before deadline).
6. Submit final docker image by the final docker deadline (mid-to-late August, TBD).
7. Submit written report and video describing your method, two weeks after the docker deadline.
